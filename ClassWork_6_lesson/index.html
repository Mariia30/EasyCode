        <p>How does it work?
            Excellent question! When you upload a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file, similar colors in your image are
            combined. This technique is called “quantization”. By reducing the number of colors, 24-bit PNG files can be
            converted to much smaller 8-bit indexed color images. All unnecessary metadata is stripped too. The result:
            better PNG files with 100% support for transparency. Have your cake and eat it too!

            In the above image the file size is reduced by more than 70%. I have excellent eyesight but can’t spot the
            difference either! Use the optimized image to save bandwidth and loading time and your website visitors will
            thank you.</p>
